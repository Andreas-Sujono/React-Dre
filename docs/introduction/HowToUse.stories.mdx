## General
you can see the list of component that listed in below documentation and
you can import those component directly from `react-dre`, for example: 
- `import { Modal, Button, Icon } from 'react-dre'`

**BUT**

we recommend you to import the component from the component modules itself to reduce the bundle size, 
the component modules name is the same with the component name.
for example:
- `import { Modal } from 'react-dre/Modal'`
- `import Modal from 'react-dre/Modal'`
- `import { Button } from 'react-dre/Button'`

## Styling
You can add the custom styling in 2 ways:

1) First, by passing a styling props. all the component must have the props of `styles` or just `style` for a single component like `Button`, 
see the props table of each component to see more details. For example, in `Modal`, you can pass 
```javascript
styles = {{
    contentcontainerStyle: {marginTop: '1em'}
    overlayStyle: {width: '80%'},
}}
```

2) second, you can use `styled-component` library. Our component parent will always a **unique classname** starts with `dre-...`,
so, you can use this as references. for the className of the child components, you must debug yourself using the `inspect element`
 
For example:
```javascript
import styled from 'styled-component'

export const ModalContainer = styled.div`
    //....
    .dre-modal{
        //pass styling here

        .overlay{
            //....
        }

        .content-container{
            //......
        }
    }
`
```


## Notes
- you  will see a `VALIDATION-PHASE` tag which means that the component can be used experimentally, but we are not guarantee if there's any bug or error exists
