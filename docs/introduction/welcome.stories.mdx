<br/>

A fully customized component library that summarizes all the great React libraries out there while maintaining the functionality and flexibility of styling.

We compile other popular component libraries like `React-Bootstrap`, `Material UI`, `Ant Design`, `Semantic UI`, `Circuit UI`, and many more  into this one library where we add more functionality and flexibility of styling

## Installation

Get the latest version:

```bash
npm install react-dre@latest
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-dre@latest
```


## How to use
you can import any component directly from `react-dre`, for example: 
- `import { Modal } from 'react-dre'`

**BUT**

we recommend you to import the component from the component modules itself to reduce the bundle size, for example:
- `import { Modal } from 'react-dre/Modal'`


## References

We aware that there are tons of other component library out there. Therefore, to make this library the best one. We need to research other library functionality before include it inside `React-dre`

**Similar component libary**, these 5 will be our main references :

1) React-bootstrap

2) Material-ui

3) Ant design

4) Semantic UI

3) Circuit-UI

## Contributions
We welcome community support with pull requests, fixing issues, and reporting bugs. Please don't hesitate to jump in.

#### Development cycle
1) Features reviewed 

2) Features must go through the **TESTING-PHASE**, where we test all the component functionality

3) Features pulled and can be used experimentally

4) Features must go through the **VALIDATION-PHASE**, where people can use commercially and reports bug if any
