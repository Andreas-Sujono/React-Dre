<center> <h1>Welcome to React Dre Storybook Documentation</h1> </center>
<br/>

A fully customized component library that summarizes all the great React libraries out there while maintaining the functionality and flexibility of styling that makes your frontend development much easier, initiated by An**DRE**as himself.

We compile other popular component libraries into this one library `React-Dre` where we add more functionality and flexibility of styling

## Installation

Get the current version:

```bash
npm install react-dre@<insert-current-version>
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-dre@<insert-current-version>
```

## How to use
you can import any component directly from `react-dre`, for example: 
- `import { Modal } from 'react-dre'`

BUT

we recommend you to import the component from the component modules itself, for example:
- `import { Modal } from 'react-dre/Modal'`

## Contributions
We welcome community support with both pull requests and reporting bugs. Please don't hesitate to jump in.

#### Development cycle
1) Features reviewed 
2) Features must go through the **TESTING-PHASE**, where we test all the component functionality
3) Features pulled and can be used experimentally
4) Features must go through the **VALIDATION-PHASE**, where people can use commercially and reports bug if any
5) Features is included in the next stable release features. 

**TESTING-PHASE** will be tested by Andreas, while **VALIDATION-PHASE** must wait for at least 2 weeks of usage by all the maintainer of React-Dre
